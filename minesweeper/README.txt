I added some features to my minesweeper game that aren't included in the requirements but I find them to make the game more enjoyable.
I have these features easily available to "turn on and off" by changing the corresponding macro in features.h:

- For random generation of mines based off of difficulty, turn on RANDOM_MINES
- For the screen to wipe after making a move, turn on SCREEN_WIPE
- For adding color to the minefield, turn on COLORS
